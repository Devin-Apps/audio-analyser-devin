# Audio Analysis Library

This library provides a set of tools for audio analysis, similar to librosa. It includes functionalities for audio file I/O, spectral representations, audio feature extraction, and basic audio effects.

## Installation

To install the library, run the following command:

```
pip install audio_analysis_lib
```

## Usage

Here are some basic examples of how to use the library:

### Reading and Writing Audio

```python
from audio_analysis.io import read_audio, write_audio

# Read an audio file
audio_data, sample_rate = read_audio('path/to/your/audio.wav')

# Write audio data to a file
write_audio(audio_data, sample_rate, 'path/to/output/audio.wav')
```

### Spectral Representations

```python
from audio_analysis.spectral import calculate_stft, calculate_istft

# Compute the Short-Time Fourier Transform
frequencies, times, stft_matrix = calculate_stft(audio_data, sample_rate)

# Inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform to reconstruct the audio signal
audio_data_reconstructed = calculate_istft(stft_matrix, sample_rate)
```

### Feature Extraction

```python
from audio_analysis.features import mfcc

# Compute Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
mfcc_features = mfcc(audio_data, sample_rate)
```

### Audio Effects

```python
from audio_analysis.effects import change_pitch, time_stretch

# Change the pitch of the audio signal
pitch_shifted_audio = change_pitch(audio_data, sample_rate, semitone_shift=2)

# Stretch the time of the audio signal
stretched_audio = time_stretch(audio_data, stretch_factor=1.5)
```
